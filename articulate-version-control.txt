What is version control and why is it important?
1. Meaning of Version Control:
The version control is a system that allows us to update repositories, for example in GitHub.
I can clone a repo in my local directory and then push the changes back to GitHub,
The version control allows to see the history of changes, to revert and/or merge changes. The version cotrol improve
the teamwork and the comunnication in a specific project.  


2. Highlight a benefit of Version Control
A remarkable benefit is to see in red the old version of the code and in green the new one with a 
strong green in the specific modified part, this benefit are useful when we need to debug and track
the progress of the project. 

3. Provide an application of Version Control. This means, provide an example of how Version Control could be used.
For example, if we are in a software project to develop a program that calculate loans, with the version control,
each teammate can work in a specific feature of the project, for example, I can work in the buttons, other teammate can 
develop the GUI and other teammate can develop the program to test the project, using version control we are able to
integrate each feature to complete the project, to debug any error, track the updates and have
organize the repositorie. 

4. Show a command used in Version Control (for example a Git command):
Git Status

5. Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words):
I like Git Status command because it help us to know the state of our directory and files, and
the staging area. The staging area is so useful because allow us to not overcommit innecesary changes
and show us which directories and files are staged in which files are not.

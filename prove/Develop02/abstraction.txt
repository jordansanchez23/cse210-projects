1)Explain the meaning of Abstraction
Asnwer: Is the process to make a complex project or idea into small or simple pieces to
facilitate the task to achieve the same project.

2)Highlight a benefit of Abstraction
Answer: It allow us to reduce significatly the complexity of some idea or project avoiding 
innecessary details and focus us in the essential parts of the main idea.


3)Provide an application of Abstraction
Answer: To make a shopping list can look like a hard process if we don't separate into small pieces
as functions, variables (methods, attributes) to accomplish the shopping list.


4)Use a code example of Abstraction from the program you wrote
if (choice == "1")
            {
                string date = DateTime.Now.ToShortDateString();
                string prompt = promptGenerator.GetRandomPrompt();
                Console.WriteLine($"Prompt: {prompt}");
                Console.Write("Response: ");
                string entryText = Console.ReadLine();
                Console.Write("Location/Context (home, office, school): ");
                string location = Console.ReadLine();
                Entry newEntry = new Entry(date, prompt, entryText, location);
                myJournal.AddEntry(newEntry);
            }

            else if (choice == "2")
            {
                myJournal.DisplayAll();
            }


5)Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words)
Answer: For example in this parte of the program.cs I was able to combine different methods(functions)
as promptGenerator (the function to choose a random prompt for the user), and use the class Entryto to store
the enough parameters to relate the Console.WriteLine(_date, _prompt, _entryText, _location);
and also the function/method DisplayAll it facilitates to show what data is in "myJournal"

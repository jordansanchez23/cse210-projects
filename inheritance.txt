1)Explain the meaning of Inheritance
Is the 3rd fundamental of OOP and is useful because you can have a base class and the 
derived class where you can reuse the variables from the father class
2)Highlight a benefit of Inheritance
The reusability helps a lot, because you can call the variables from the base class to use these in derived class
3)Provide an application of Inheritance
For example in the activity, we can have the base activity that is where you can put attributes attributes
as the starting and ending messange, the spiner and the countdown, then you can apply them in each activity
4)Use a code example of Inheritance from the program you wrote
5)Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words)
public void ShowSpinner(int seconds)
    {
        List<string> animationStrings = new List<string> { "|", "/", "-", "\\" };

        DateTime endTime = DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(seconds);
        int i = 0;

        while (DateTime.Now < endTime)
        {
            string s = animationStrings[i];
            Console.Write(s);
            Thread.Sleep(250);
            Console.Write("\b \b");
            i = (i + 1) % animationStrings.Count;
        }
    }

In this fragment I share the spinner, I used in different parts this spinner and because this method
is inside the base class has the property to be reusable and the 3 activities (breathing, listing and reflecting)
The Inheritance allows hierarchical and combined with abstracion and encapsulation helps to make the program more organized and more efficient,
Obviously not doing more than 4 childs per base class, because in the future it's gonna be hard to relate the different child classes.
